<p> So people what is the truth. The truth is that it is hard for people to do stuff with people on their backs. 
leave people alone. For people trying to comeout support their descision to come out to family when they are ready because you do not know if they will get zoned out from family or not talked to anymore or hated. 
Everyone has a story, DONT YOU. </p>
