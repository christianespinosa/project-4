 <center><p> So people for the first image I put this up because why would people assume if you are lesbian or gay just by looking at you.
 Like some people take that to offense.Like again im gay but i dont act really femine like wearing make up, wearing high heels, putting on nails, or wearing booty shorts.
 If you think someone is gay or bi or lesbian or anything else dont say it and dont ask them. Wait for them to tell you or hold your peace. For the second image why are people going to say that, do gays have to have the man or the women of the relationship why cant they be whatever.
It is like saying when a guy and a girl date and the guy is femine the guy is the girl too. Why do we have to put a woman or guy tag to LGBTQ relationships. Lastly for the last image, you see people that is what I like to here if you made stupid mistakes when you were younger and you fixed them and you apologized that is good. 
But for the younger kids lets try not to make those mistakes even though everyone makes mistakes in their life time because it is natural. </p></center>
